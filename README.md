# Simple Tag Reinforcement Learning Project

## Overview
This project is part of the coursework for 02456 Deep Learning, Fall 2022. It focuses on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques in the Simple Tag environment. Our goal is to train an agent that can effectively play the game of tag, demonstrating the core principles of RL such as exploration, exploitation, and learning strategy.

## Environment
The Simple Tag environment is a multi-agent domain where agents interact in a closed, two-dimensional space. Agents can move in the environment and need to either catch (for the tagger) or evade (for the others) each other. The environment provides a unique challenge for RL algorithms due to its multi-agent dynamics and continuous state space.
